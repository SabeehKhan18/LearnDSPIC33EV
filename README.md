# Learn dsPIC33EV

This repository is to help me and collaborators learn the basics of the [dsPIC33EV][1]. The dsPIC33EV was chosen because it is a microcontroller
used for projects on our FSAE (Formula Society of Automotive Engineers) team. 
All information may vary and may not be accurate or the best way to achieve the goal. All projects include a description, commented code, and a schematic.



## Projects

This is the suggested order for the projects.

1. [LED_ON_BUTTON_PRESS](LED_ON_BUTTON_PRESS.X)
2. [LED_ON_BUTTON_PRESS_INTERNAL_PULLUP](LED_ON_BUTTON_PRESS_INTENRAL_PULLUP.X)
3. [LED_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION_INTERRUPT](LED_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION_INTERRUPT.X)
4. [LED_BLINK_TIMER](LED_BLINK_TIMER.X)
5. [VARIABLE_LED_BLINK_TIMER](VARIABLE_LED_BLINK_TIMER.X)
